# Bloodtest
Comparison between models for Blood Test dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/blood-cells

Training, Testing, and Validation Data is found at the above website, and to be loaded in through the code. The datasets should be downloaded as a zip file that you will extract into a directory that you name, preferably without spaces, i.e. Bloodtest. Once that's done, you should find 2 folders in your directory: dataset-master and dataset2-master.

At the variables: train_path, test_path, in main.py, set the 

train_path variable to '<Directory you extracted the files to>/dataset2-master/images/TRAIN'
  
test_path variable to '<Directory you extracted the files to>/dataset2-master/images/TEST'.

This should properly load in the data that we used for this project.
